Objects\\ncomprise the logical groupings of like counters for a\\nspecific device or feature, such as Cisco Unified IP\\nPhones or Unified Communications Manager System\\nPerformance. Counters measure various aspects of\\nsystem performance. Counters measure statistics such\\nas the number of registered phones, calls that are\\nattempted and calls in progress.Cisco Unified Real-Time Monitoring Tool (RTMT)\\nAdministrators use alarms to obtain run-time status\\nand state of the Unified Communications Manager\\nsystem. Alarms contain information about system\\nproblems such as explanation and recommended\\naction.\\nAdministrators search the alarm definitions database\\nfor alarm information. The alarm definition contains\\na description of the alarm and recommended actions.Alarms\\nAdministrators and Cisco engineers use trace files to\\nobtain specific information about Unified\\nCommunications Manager service problems. Cisco\\nUnified Serviceability sends configured trace\\ninformation to the trace log file. Two types of trace\\nlog files exist: SDI and SDL.\\nEvery service includes a default trace log file. The\\nsystem traces system diagnostic interface (SDI)\\ninformation from the services and logs run-time events\\nand traces to a log file.\\nThe SDL trace log file contains call-processing\\ninformation from services such as Cisco CallManager\\nand Cisco CTIManager. The system traces the signal\\ndistribution layer (SDL) of the call and logs state\\ntransitions into a log file.\\nIn most cases, you will only gather SDL\\ntraces when Cisco Technical Assistance\\nCenter (TAC) requests you to do so.NoteTrace\\nThis term designates voice quality and general\\nproblem-reporting utility in Cisco Unified\\nServiceability.Quality Report Tool\\nTroubleshooting Guide for Cisco Unified Communications Manager, Release 12.5(1)\\n6Troubleshooting Tools\\nCisco Unified Serviceability Troubleshooting ToolsDefinition Term\\nThis offering increases the speed with which Cisco\\ntechnical assistance staff can diagnose issues with\\nyour infrastructure.

You can change the passw ord after install, but\\nyou never can change the account name.\\nA command represents a text instruction that caused the system to perform some function. Comm ands may\\nbe stand alone, or they can have mandatory or optional arguments or options.\\nA level comprises a collection of commands; for example, show designates a level, whe reas show status\\nspecifies a command. Each level and command also includes an associated privil ege level. You can execute\\na command only if you have sufficient privilege level.\\nFor complete information on the Unified Communications Manager CLI command set, see the Command\\nLine Interface Reference Guide for Cisco Unified Solutions .\\nkerneldump Utility\\nThe kerneldump utility allows you to collect crash dump logs locally on the affected ma chine without requiring\\na secondary server.\\nIn a Unified Communications Manager cluster, you only need to ensure the kerneldump utility is enabled on\\nthe server before you can collect the crash dump information.\\nCisco recommends that you verify the kerneldump utility is enabled after you install Unifi ed Communications\\nManager to allow for more efficient troubleshooting. If you have not already done so, enable the kerneldum p\\nutility before you upgrade the Unified Communications Manager from supported appliance releases.Note\\nEnabling or disabling the kerneldump utility will require a reboot of the node. Do not execute the e nable\\ncommand unless you are within a window where a reboot would be acceptable.Important\\nTroubleshooting Guide for Cisco Unified Communications Manager, Release 12.5(1)\\n7Troubleshooting Tools\\nCommand Line InterfaceThe command line interface (CLI) for the Cisco Unified Communications Operating System ca n be used to\\nenable, disable, or check the status of the kerneldump utility.\\nUse the following procedure to enable the kernel dump utility:\\nWorking with Files That Are Collected by the Utility\\nTo view the crash information from the kerneldump utility, use the Cisco Unified Real-Tim e Monitoring Tool\\nor the command line interface (CLI). To collect the kerneldump logs by using the Cisco Unified Real-Time\\nMonitoring Tool, choose the Collect Files option from Trace & Log Central. From the Select Sys tem\\nServices/Applications tab, choose the Kerneldump logs check box. For more information on colle cting files\\nusing Cisco Unified Real-Time Monitoring Tool, see the Cisco Unified Real-Time Monitoring Tool\\nAdministration Guide .\\nTo use the CLI to collect the kerneldump logs, use the “file” CLI commands on the files in the crash directory.\\nThese are found under the “activelog” partition. The log filenames begin with the IP address of the kerneld ump\\nclient and end with the date that the file is created. For more information on the file c ommands, refer to the\\nCommand Line Interface Reference Guide for Cisco Unified Solutions .\\nEnable the Kerneldump Utility\\nUse this procedure to enable the kerneldump utility. In the event of a kernel crash, the utilit y provides a\\nmechanism for collecting and dumping the crash. You can configure the utility to dump logs to the local server\\nor to an external server.\\nProcedure\\nStep 1 Log in to the Command Line Interface.\\nStep 2 Complete either of the following:\\n• To dump kernel crashes on the local server, run the utils os kernelcrash enable CLI command.\\n• To dump kernel crashes to an external server, run the utils os kerneldump ssh enable <ip_address>\\nCLI command with the IP address of the external server.\\nStep 3 Reboot the server.\\nExample\\nIf you need to disable the kerneldump utility, you can run the utils os kernelcrash disable CLI\\ncommand to disable the local server for core dumps and the utils os kerneldump ssh disable\\n<ip_address> CLI command to disable the utility on the external server.Note\\nWhat to do next\\nConfigure an email alert in the Real-Time Monitoring Tool to be advised of core dumps.

A part of the TCP/IP protocol suite, SNMP enables adm inistrators to\\nremotely manage network performance, find and solve network problems, and plan for network growth.\\nAn SNMP-managed network comprises three key components: managed devices, agents, and ne twork\\nmanagement systems.\\n• A managed device designates a network node that contains an SNMP agent and resides on a m anaged\\nnetwork. Managed devices collect and store management information and make it availabl e by using\\nSNMP.\\n• An agent, as network management software, resides on a managed device. An agent conta ins local\\nknowledge of management information and translates it into a form that is compatible with SNMP.\\n•A network management system comprises an SNMP management application together with the compute r\\non which it runs. An NMS executes applications that monitor and control managed devices. An NMS\\nprovides the bulk of the processing and memory resources that are required for network management.\\nThe following NMSs share compatibility with Unified Communications Manager:\\n• CiscoWorks Common Services Software\\n• HP OpenView\\n•Third-party applications that support SNMP and Unified Communications Man ager SNMP interfaces\\nSniffer Traces\\nTypically, you collect sniffer traces by connecting a laptop or other sniffer-equipped devi ce on a Catalyst port\\nthat is configured to span the VLAN or port(s) (CatOS, Cat6K-IOS, XL-IOS) that contains the t rouble\\ninformation. If no free port is available, connect the sniffer-equipped device on a hub that is insert ed between\\nthe switch and the device.\\nTroubleshooting Guide for Cisco Unified Communications Manager, Release 12.5(1)\\n10Troubleshooting Tools\\nCisco Discovery Protocol SupportTo help facilitate reading and interpreting of the traces by the TAC engineer, Cisco recommends using Sniffer\\nPro software because it is widely used within the TAC.Tip\\nHave available the IP/MAC addresses of all equipment that is involved, such as IP phones, ga teways, Unified\\nCommunications Managers, and so on.\\nDebugs\\nThe output from debug privileged EXEC commands provides diagnostic information about a variety of\\ninternetworking event that relate to protocol status and network activity in general.\\nSet up your terminal emulator software (such as HyperTerminal), so it can capture the debug output to a file.\\nIn HyperTerminal, click Transfer ; then, click Capture Text and choose the appropriate options.\\nBefore running any IOS voice gateway debugs, make sure that\\nservice timestamps debug datetime msec is globally configured on the gateway.\\nAvoid collecting debugs in a live environment during operation hours. Note\\nPreferably, collect debugs during non-working hours. If you must collect debugs in a live environment,\\nconfigure no logging console andlogging buffered . To collect the debugs, use show log .\\nBecause some debugs can be lengthy, collect them directly on the console port (default logging console )\\nor on the buffer ( logging buffer ). Collecting debugs over a Telnet session may impact the device performance,\\nand the result could be incomplete debugs, which requires that you re-collect them.\\nTo stop a debug, use the no debug all orundebug all commands. Verify that the debugs have been turned\\noff by using the command show debug .\\nCisco Secure Telnet\\nCisco Secure Telnet allows Cisco Service Engineers (CSE) transparent firewall acce ss to theUnified\\nCommunications Manager node on your site. Using strong encryption, Cisco Secure Telnet enables a special\\nTelnet client from Cisco Systems to connect to a Telnet daemon behind your firewall. T his secure connection\\nallows remote monitoring and troubleshooting of your Unified Communications Manager nodes, without\\nrequiring firewall modifications.\\nCisco provides this service only with your permission.

The release note s provide\\ndescriptions and workaround solutions for known problems.Tip\\nKnow where your devices are registered. Tip\\nEach Unified Communications Manager log traces files locally. If a phone or gateway i s registered to a\\nparticular Unified Communications Manager, the call processing gets done on thatUnified Communications\\nManager if the call is initiated there. You will need to capture traces on that Unified Communications Manager\\nto debug a problem.\\nA common mistake involves having devices that are registered on a subscriber server but are c apturing traces\\non the publisher server. These trace files will be nearly empty (and definitely will not have the call in them).\\nTroubleshooting Guide for Cisco Unified Communications Manager, Release 12.5(1)\\n20Troubleshooting Tools\\nTroubleshooting TipsAnother common problem involves having Device 1 registered to CM1 and Device 2 registered t o CM2. If\\nDevice 1 calls Device 2, the call trace occurs in CM1, and, if Device 2 calls De vice 1, the trace occurs in\\nCM2. If you are troubleshooting a two-way calling issue, you need both traces from both Unified\\nCommunications Managers to obtain all the information that is needed to troubleshoot.\\nKnow the approximate time of the problem. Tip\\nMultiple calls may have occurred, so knowing the approximate time of the call helps TAC qui ckly locate the\\ntrouble.\\nYou can obtain phone statistics on a Cisco Unified IP Phone 79xx by pressing the ior?button twice during\\nan active call.\\nWhen you are running a test to reproduce the issue and produce information, know the following data that is\\ncrucial to understanding the issue:\\n• Calling number/called number\\n• Any other number that is involved in the specific scenario\\n• Time of the call\\nRemember that time synchronization of all equipment is important for\\ntroubleshooting.Note\\nIf you are reproducing a problem, make sure to choose the file for the timeframe by looking at the modificati on\\ndate and the time stamps in the file. The best way to collect the right trace mea ns that you reproduce a problem\\nand then quickly locate the most recent file and copy it from the Unified Communications Mana ger server.\\nSave the log files to prevent them from being overwritten. Tip\\nFiles will get overwritten after some time. The only way to know which file is bei ng logged to is to choose\\nView >Refresh on the menu bar and look at the dates and times on the files.\\nSystem History Log\\nThis system history log provides a central location for getting a quick overview of the initia l system install,\\nsystem upgrades, Cisco option installations, and DRS backups and DRS restores, as well a s switch version\\nand reboot history.\\nRelated Topics\\nSystem History Log Overview , on page 22\\nSystem History Log Fields , on page 22\\nAccessing the System History Log , on page 23\\nTroubleshooting Guide for Cisco Unified Communications Manager, Release 12.5(1)\\n21Troubleshooting Tools\\nSystem History LogSystem History Log Overview\\nThesystemhistorylogexistsasasimpleASCIIfile, system-history.log ,andthedatadoesnotgetmaintained\\ninthedatabase.Becauseitdoesnotgetexcessivelylarge,thesystemhistoryfile doesnotgetrotated.\\nThesystemhistorylogprovidesthefollowingfunctions:\\n• Logstheinitialsoftwareinstallationonaserver.\\n• Logsthesuccess,failure,orcancellationofeverysoftwareupgrade(Ciscooptionfilesa ndpatches).\\n• LogseveryDRSbackupandrestorethatisperformed.\\n• LogseveryinvocationofSwitchVersionthatisissuedthrougheithertheCLIortheGUI.\\n• LogseveryinvocationofRestartandShutdownthatisissuedthrougheithertheCLIortheGUI.\\n• Logseverybootofthesystem.Ifnotcorrelatedwitharestartorshutdownentry,thebootisthe result\\nofamanualreboot,powercycle,orkernelpanic.\\n•Maintainsasinglefilethatcontainsthesystemhistory,sinceinitialinstall ationorsincefeatureavailability.\\n• Existsintheinstallfolder.YoucanaccessthelogfromtheCLIbyusingthe filecommandsorfromthe\\nRealTimeMonitoringTool(RTMT).\\nSystem History Log Fields\\nThelogdisplaysacommonheaderthatcontainsinformationabouttheproductname,productversion,and\\nkernelimage;forexample:\\n=====================================\\nProductName-CiscoUnifiedCommunicationsManager\\nProductVersion-7.1.0.39000-9023\\nKernelImage-2.6.9-67.EL\\n=====================================\\nEachsystemhistorylogentrycontainsthefollowingfields:\\ntimestamp userid action description start/result\\nThesystemhistorylogfieldscancontainthefollowingvalues:\\n•timestamp—Displaysthelocaltimeanddateontheserverwiththeformat mm/dd/yyyy hh:mm:ss .\\n•userid—Displaystheusernameoftheuserwhoinvokestheaction.\\n•action—Displaysoneofthefollowingactions:\\n• Install\\n• WindowsUpgrade\\n• UpgradeDuringInstall\\n• Upgrade\\n• CiscoOptionInstall\\nTroubleshooting Guide for Cisco Unified Communications Manager, Release 12.5(1)\\n22Troubleshooting Tools\\nSystem History Log Overview• Switch Version\\n• System Restart\\n• Shutdown\\n• Boot\\n• DRS Backup\\n• DRS Restore\\n•description —Displays one of the following messages:\\n•Version : Displays for the Basic Install, Windows Upgrade, Upgrade During Install, and Upgrade\\nactions.\\n•Cisco Option file name : Displays for the Cisco Option Install action.\\n•Timestamp : Displays for the DRS Backup and DRS Restore actions.\\n•Active version to inactive version : Displays for the Switch Version action.\\n•Active version : Displays for the System Restart, Shutdown, and Boot actions.\\n•result —Displays the following results:\\n• Start\\n• Success or Failure\\n• Cancel\\nThe following shows a sample of the system history log.\\nadmin:file dump install system-history.log============ ===========================\\nProduct Name - Cisco Unified Communications Manager\\nProduct Version - 6.1.2.9901-117\\nKernel Image - 2.4.21-47.EL.cs.3BOOT\\n=======================================\\n07/25/2008 14:20:06 | root: Install 6.1.2.9901-117 Start\\n07/25/2008 15:05:37 | root: Install 6.1.2.9901-117 Success\\n07/25/2008 15:05:38 | root: Boot 6.1.2.9901-117 Start\\n07/30/2008 10:08:56 | root: Upgrade 6.1.2.9901-126 Start\\n07/30/2008 10:46:31 | root: Upgrade 6.1.2.9901-126 Success\\n07/30/2008 10:46:43 | root: Switch Version 6.1.2.9901-117 to 6.1.2.9901-126 Start\\n07/30/2008 10:48:39 | root: Switch Version 6.1.2.9901-117 to 6.1.2.9901-126 Success\\n07/30/2008 10:48:39 | root: Restart 6.1.2.9901-126 Start\\n07/30/2008 10:51:27 | root: Boot 6.1.2.9901-126 Start\\n08/01/2008 16:29:31 | root: Restart 6.1.2.9901-126 Start\\n08/01/2008 16:32:31 | root: Boot 6.1.2.9901-126 Start\\nAccessing the System History Log\\nYou can use either the CLI or RTMT to access the system history log.\\nTroubleshooting Guide for Cisco Unified Communications Manager, Release 12.5(1)\\n23Troubleshooting Tools\\nAccessing the System History LogUsing the CLI\\nYou can access the system history log by using the CLI filecommand; for example:\\n•file view install system-history.log\\n•file get install system-history.log\\nFor more information on the CLI filecommands, see the Command Line Interface Reference Guide for Cisco\\nUnified Solutions .\\nUsing RTMT\\nYou can also access the system history log by using RTMT.

To determine\\nif you are prepared for a network failure, answer the following questions:\\n•Do you have an accurate physical and logical map of your internetwork that outlines the physical locatio n\\nof all of the devices on the network and how they are connected as well as a logical map of network\\naddresses, network numbers, and subnetworks?\\n• Do you have a list of all network protocols that are implemented in your network for each of t he protocols\\nimplemented and a list of the network numbers, subnetworks, zones, and areas that are ass ociated with\\nthem?\\n• Do you know which protocols are being routed and the correct, up-to-date configuration information for\\neach protocol?\\n• Do you know which protocols are being bridged? Are any filters configured in any of these bridges, and\\ndo you have a copy of these configurations? Is this applicable to Unified Communications Manager?\\n• Do you know all the points of contact to external networks, including any connections to the Interne t?\\nFor each external network connection, do you know what routing protocol is being used?\\n• Has your organization documented normal network behavior and performance, so you can compare\\ncurrent problems with a baseline?\\nIf you can answer yes to these questions, faster recovery from a failure results.\\nWhere to Find More Information\\nUse the following links for information on various IP telephony topics:\\n• For further information about related Cisco IP telephony applications and products, refer to the Cisco\\nUnified Communications Manager Documentation Guide .

Objects\\ncomprise the logical groupings of like counters for a\\nspecific device or feature, such as Cisco Unified IP\\nPhones or Unified Communications Manager System\\nPerformance. Counters measure various aspects of\\nsystem performance. Counters measure statistics such\\nas the number of registered phones, calls that are\\nattempted and calls in progress.Cisco Unified Real-Time Monitoring Tool (RTMT)\\nAdministrators use alarms to obtain run-time status\\nand state of the Unified Communications Manager\\nsystem. Alarms contain information about system\\nproblems such as explanation and recommended\\naction.\\nAdministrators search the alarm definitions database\\nfor alarm information. The alarm definition contains\\na description of the alarm and recommended actions.Alarms\\nAdministrators and Cisco engineers use trace files to\\nobtain specific information about Unified\\nCommunications Manager service problems. Cisco\\nUnified Serviceability sends configured trace\\ninformation to the trace log file. Two types of trace\\nlog files exist: SDI and SDL.\\nEvery service includes a default trace log file. The\\nsystem traces system diagnostic interface (SDI)\\ninformation from the services and logs run-time events\\nand traces to a log file.\\nThe SDL trace log file contains call-processing\\ninformation from services such as Cisco CallManager\\nand Cisco CTIManager. The system traces the signal\\ndistribution layer (SDL) of the call and logs state\\ntransitions into a log file.\\nIn most cases, you will only gather SDL\\ntraces when Cisco Technical Assistance\\nCenter (TAC) requests you to do so.NoteTrace\\nThis term designates voice quality and general\\nproblem-reporting utility in Cisco Unified\\nServiceability.Quality Report Tool\\nTroubleshooting Guide for Cisco Unified Communications Manager, Release 12.5(1)\\n6Troubleshooting Tools\\nCisco Unified Serviceability Troubleshooting ToolsDefinition Term\\nThis offering increases the speed with which Cisco\\ntechnical assistance staff can diagnose issues with\\nyour infrastructure.

You can change the passw ord after install, but\\nyou never can change the account name.\\nA command represents a text instruction that caused the system to perform some function. Comm ands may\\nbe stand alone, or they can have mandatory or optional arguments or options.\\nA level comprises a collection of commands; for example, show designates a level, whe reas show status\\nspecifies a command. Each level and command also includes an associated privil ege level. You can execute\\na command only if you have sufficient privilege level.\\nFor complete information on the Unified Communications Manager CLI command set, see the Command\\nLine Interface Reference Guide for Cisco Unified Solutions .\\nkerneldump Utility\\nThe kerneldump utility allows you to collect crash dump logs locally on the affected ma chine without requiring\\na secondary server.\\nIn a Unified Communications Manager cluster, you only need to ensure the kerneldump utility is enabled on\\nthe server before you can collect the crash dump information.\\nCisco recommends that you verify the kerneldump utility is enabled after you install Unifi ed Communications\\nManager to allow for more efficient troubleshooting. If you have not already done so, enable the kerneldum p\\nutility before you upgrade the Unified Communications Manager from supported appliance releases.Note\\nEnabling or disabling the kerneldump utility will require a reboot of the node. Do not execute the e nable\\ncommand unless you are within a window where a reboot would be acceptable.Important\\nTroubleshooting Guide for Cisco Unified Communications Manager, Release 12.5(1)\\n7Troubleshooting Tools\\nCommand Line InterfaceThe command line interface (CLI) for the Cisco Unified Communications Operating System ca n be used to\\nenable, disable, or check the status of the kerneldump utility.\\nUse the following procedure to enable the kernel dump utility:\\nWorking with Files That Are Collected by the Utility\\nTo view the crash information from the kerneldump utility, use the Cisco Unified Real-Tim e Monitoring Tool\\nor the command line interface (CLI). To collect the kerneldump logs by using the Cisco Unified Real-Time\\nMonitoring Tool, choose the Collect Files option from Trace & Log Central. From the Select Sys tem\\nServices/Applications tab, choose the Kerneldump logs check box. For more information on colle cting files\\nusing Cisco Unified Real-Time Monitoring Tool, see the Cisco Unified Real-Time Monitoring Tool\\nAdministration Guide .\\nTo use the CLI to collect the kerneldump logs, use the “file” CLI commands on the files in the crash directory.\\nThese are found under the “activelog” partition. The log filenames begin with the IP address of the kerneld ump\\nclient and end with the date that the file is created. For more information on the file c ommands, refer to the\\nCommand Line Interface Reference Guide for Cisco Unified Solutions .\\nEnable the Kerneldump Utility\\nUse this procedure to enable the kerneldump utility.

A part of the TCP/IP protocol suite, SNMP enables adm inistrators to\\nremotely manage network performance, find and solve network problems, and plan for network growth.\\nAn SNMP-managed network comprises three key components: managed devices, agents, and ne twork\\nmanagement systems.\\n• A managed device designates a network node that contains an SNMP agent and resides on a m anaged\\nnetwork. Managed devices collect and store management information and make it availabl e by using\\nSNMP.\\n• An agent, as network management software, resides on a managed device. An agent conta ins local\\nknowledge of management information and translates it into a form that is compatible with SNMP.\\n•A network management system comprises an SNMP management application together with the compute r\\non which it runs. An NMS executes applications that monitor and control managed devices. An NMS\\nprovides the bulk of the processing and memory resources that are required for network management.\\nThe following NMSs share compatibility with Unified Communications Manager:\\n• CiscoWorks Common Services Software\\n• HP OpenView\\n•Third-party applications that support SNMP and Unified Communications Man ager SNMP interfaces\\nSniffer Traces\\nTypically, you collect sniffer traces by connecting a laptop or other sniffer-equipped devi ce on a Catalyst port\\nthat is configured to span the VLAN or port(s) (CatOS, Cat6K-IOS, XL-IOS) that contains the t rouble\\ninformation. If no free port is available, connect the sniffer-equipped device on a hub that is insert ed between\\nthe switch and the device.\\nTroubleshooting Guide for Cisco Unified Communications Manager, Release 12.5(1)\\n10Troubleshooting Tools\\nCisco Discovery Protocol SupportTo help facilitate reading and interpreting of the traces by the TAC engineer, Cisco recommends using Sniffer\\nPro software because it is widely used within the TAC.Tip\\nHave available the IP/MAC addresses of all equipment that is involved, such as IP phones, ga teways, Unified\\nCommunications Managers, and so on.\\nDebugs\\nThe output from debug privileged EXEC commands provides diagnostic information about a variety of\\ninternetworking event that relate to protocol status and network activity in general.\\nSet up your terminal emulator software (such as HyperTerminal), so it can capture the debug output to a file.\\nIn HyperTerminal, click Transfer ; then, click Capture Text and choose the appropriate options.\\nBefore running any IOS voice gateway debugs, make sure that\\nservice timestamps debug datetime msec is globally configured on the gateway.\\nAvoid collecting debugs in a live environment during operation hours. Note\\nPreferably, collect debugs during non-working hours. If you must collect debugs in a live environment,\\nconfigure no logging console andlogging buffered . To collect the debugs, use show log .\\nBecause some debugs can be lengthy, collect them directly on the console port (default logging console )\\nor on the buffer ( logging buffer ). Collecting debugs over a Telnet session may impact the device performance,\\nand the result could be incomplete debugs, which requires that you re-collect them.\\nTo stop a debug, use the no debug all orundebug all commands. Verify that the debugs have been turned\\noff by using the command show debug .\\nCisco Secure Telnet\\nCisco Secure Telnet allows Cisco Service Engineers (CSE) transparent firewall acce ss to theUnified\\nCommunications Manager node on your site. Using strong encryption, Cisco Secure Telnet enables a special\\nTelnet client from Cisco Systems to connect to a Telnet daemon behind your firewall. T his secure connection\\nallows remote monitoring and troubleshooting of your Unified Communications Manager nodes, without\\nrequiring firewall modifications.\\nCisco provides this service only with your permission.

These trace files will be nearly empty (and definitely will not have the call in them).\\nTroubleshooting Guide for Cisco Unified Communications Manager, Release 12.5(1)\\n20Troubleshooting Tools\\nTroubleshooting TipsAnother common problem involves having Device 1 registered to CM1 and Device 2 registered t o CM2. If\\nDevice 1 calls Device 2, the call trace occurs in CM1, and, if Device 2 calls De vice 1, the trace occurs in\\nCM2. If you are troubleshooting a two-way calling issue, you need both traces from both Unified\\nCommunications Managers to obtain all the information that is needed to troubleshoot.\\nKnow the approximate time of the problem. Tip\\nMultiple calls may have occurred, so knowing the approximate time of the call helps TAC qui ckly locate the\\ntrouble.\\nYou can obtain phone statistics on a Cisco Unified IP Phone 79xx by pressing the ior?button twice during\\nan active call.\\nWhen you are running a test to reproduce the issue and produce information, know the following data that is\\ncrucial to understanding the issue:\\n• Calling number/called number\\n• Any other number that is involved in the specific scenario\\n• Time of the call\\nRemember that time synchronization of all equipment is important for\\ntroubleshooting.Note\\nIf you are reproducing a problem, make sure to choose the file for the timeframe by looking at the modificati on\\ndate and the time stamps in the file. The best way to collect the right trace mea ns that you reproduce a problem\\nand then quickly locate the most recent file and copy it from the Unified Communications Mana ger server.\\nSave the log files to prevent them from being overwritten. Tip\\nFiles will get overwritten after some time. The only way to know which file is bei ng logged to is to choose\\nView >Refresh on the menu bar and look at the dates and times on the files.\\nSystem History Log\\nThis system history log provides a central location for getting a quick overview of the initia l system install,\\nsystem upgrades, Cisco option installations, and DRS backups and DRS restores, as well a s switch version\\nand reboot history.\\nRelated Topics\\nSystem History Log Overview , on page 22\\nSystem History Log Fields , on page 22\\nAccessing the System History Log , on page 23\\nTroubleshooting Guide for Cisco Unified Communications Manager, Release 12.5(1)\\n21Troubleshooting Tools\\nSystem History LogSystem History Log Overview\\nThesystemhistorylogexistsasasimpleASCIIfile, system-history.log ,andthedatadoesnotgetmaintained\\ninthedatabase.Becauseitdoesnotgetexcessivelylarge,thesystemhistoryfile doesnotgetrotated.\\nThesystemhistorylogprovidesthefollowingfunctions:\\n• Logstheinitialsoftwareinstallationonaserver.\\n• Logsthesuccess,failure,orcancellationofeverysoftwareupgrade(Ciscooptionfilesa ndpatches).\\n• LogseveryDRSbackupandrestorethatisperformed.\\n• LogseveryinvocationofSwitchVersionthatisissuedthrougheithertheCLIortheGUI.\\n• LogseveryinvocationofRestartandShutdownthatisissuedthrougheithertheCLIortheGUI.\\n• Logseverybootofthesystem.Ifnotcorrelatedwitharestartorshutdownentry,thebootisthe result\\nofamanualreboot,powercycle,orkernelpanic.\\n•Maintainsasinglefilethatcontainsthesystemhistory,sinceinitialinstall ationorsincefeatureavailability.\\n• Existsintheinstallfolder.YoucanaccessthelogfromtheCLIbyusingthe filecommandsorfromthe\\nRealTimeMonitoringTool(RTMT).\\nSystem History Log Fields\\nThelogdisplaysacommonheaderthatcontainsinformationabouttheproductname,productversion,and\\nkernelimage;forexample:\\n=====================================\\nProductName-CiscoUnifiedCommunicationsManager\\nProductVersion-7.1.0.39000-9023\\nKernelImage-2.6.9-67.EL\\n=====================================\\nEachsystemhistorylogentrycontainsthefollowingfields:\\ntimestamp userid action description start/result\\nThesystemhistorylogfieldscancontainthefollowingvalues:\\n•timestamp—Displaysthelocaltimeanddateontheserverwiththeformat mm/dd/yyyy hh:mm:ss .\\n•userid—Displaystheusernameoftheuserwhoinvokestheaction.\\n•action—Displaysoneofthefollowingactions:\\n• Install\\n• WindowsUpgrade\\n• UpgradeDuringInstall\\n• Upgrade\\n• CiscoOptionInstall\\nTroubleshooting Guide for Cisco Unified Communications Manager, Release 12.5(1)\\n22Troubleshooting Tools\\nSystem History Log Overview• Switch Version\\n• System Restart\\n• Shutdown\\n• Boot\\n• DRS Backup\\n• DRS Restore\\n•description —Displays one of the following messages:\\n•Version : Displays for the Basic Install, Windows Upgrade, Upgrade During Install, and Upgrade\\nactions.\\n•Cisco Option file name : Displays for the Cisco Option Install action.\\n•Timestamp : Displays for the DRS Backup and DRS Restore actions.\\n•Active version to inactive version : Displays for the Switch Version action.\\n•Active version : Displays for the System Restart, Shutdown, and Boot actions.\\n•result —Displays the following results:\\n• Start\\n• Success or Failure\\n• Cancel\\nThe following shows a sample of the system history log.\\nadmin:file dump install system-history.log============ ===========================\\nProduct Name - Cisco Unified Communications Manager\\nProduct Version - 6.1.2.9901-117\\nKernel Image - 2.4.21-47.EL.cs.3BOOT\\n=======================================\\n07/25/2008 14:20:06 | root: Install 6.1.2.9901-117 Start\\n07/25/2008 15:05:37 | root: Install 6.1.2.9901-117 Success\\n07/25/2008 15:05:38 | root: Boot 6.1.2.9901-117 Start\\n07/30/2008 10:08:56 | root: Upgrade 6.1.2.9901-126 Start\\n07/30/2008 10:46:31 | root: Upgrade 6.1.2.9901-126 Success\\n07/30/2008 10:46:43 | root: Switch Version 6.1.2.9901-117 to 6.1.2.9901-126 Start\\n07/30/2008 10:48:39 | root: Switch Version 6.1.2.9901-117 to 6.1.2.9901-126 Success\\n07/30/2008 10:48:39 | root: Restart 6.1.2.9901-126 Start\\n07/30/2008 10:51:27 | root: Boot 6.1.2.9901-126 Start\\n08/01/2008 16:29:31 | root: Restart 6.1.2.9901-126 Start\\n08/01/2008 16:32:31 | root: Boot 6.1.2.9901-126 Start\\nAccessing the System History Log\\nYou can use either the CLI or RTMT to access the system history log.\\nTroubleshooting Guide for Cisco Unified Communications Manager, Release 12.5(1)\\n23Troubleshooting Tools\\nAccessing the System History LogUsing the CLI\\nYou can access the system history log by using the CLI filecommand; for example:\\n•file view install system-history.log\\n•file get install system-history.log\\nFor more information on the CLI filecommands, see the Command Line Interface Reference Guide for Cisco\\nUnified Solutions .\\nUsing RTMT\\nYou can also access the system history log by using RTMT.

By default , the\\nCCMAdministrator has the audit role after fresh installs and upgrades. The CCMAdministrator can assign\\nthe “standard audit users” group to a new user that the CCMAdministrator specifically cre ates for audit\\npurposes. The CCMAdministrator can then be removed from the audit user group. The “standard audit log\\nconfiguration” role provides the ability to delete audit logs, read/update access to Cisco U nified Real-Time\\nMonitoring Tool, Trace Collection Tool, RTMT Alert Configuration, the Control Center - Network Se rvices\\nwindow, RTMT Profile Saving, the Audit Configuration window, and a new resource called Audit Trac es.\\nFor Cisco Unity Connection in Cisco Business Edition 5000, the application administrati on account that was\\ncreated during installation has the Audit Administrator role and can assign other adm inistrative users to the\\nrole.Tip\\nUnified Communications Manager creates one application audit log file until the configured m aximum file\\nsize is reached; then, it closes and creates a new application audit log file.
