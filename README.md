# Chatgpt
Retrieval Augmented Generation  
The idea is simple. Instead of asking a question directly, the process first uses the user question to perform a search to retrieve relevant documents from the internal dataset and then provides these documents together with the question to ChatGPT. With the additional context, ChatGPT can answer as though it has been trained with the internal dataset.
